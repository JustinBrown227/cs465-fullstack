CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

Architecture

• Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
The frontend of this application was developed using a combination of Express HTML templates, JavaScript, and a Single-Page Application (SPA) approach:
Express HTML & JavaScript: Utilized for rendering static pages and handling dynamic interactions through JavaScript.
SPA: Implemented to improve performance and user experience by reducing page reloads. The SPA dynamically updates content using API calls to the backend, providing a seamless user experience.

• Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database because of its flexibility and scalability. Unlike SQL databases, MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, making it easier to handle complex, unstructured data. Additionally, MongoDB's schema-less design allows for efficient updates and changes without major modifications to the database structure.

Functionality

• How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
JSON is different from JavaScript in that it is a lightweight data format used for exchanging data between a client and a server. It is language-independent, making it ideal for API communication. JSON serves as the bridge between the frontend and backend, allowing data to be sent and received efficiently.

• Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
Throughout the development process I refactored my code to improve functionality and efficiency. For example, I modularized my backend routes and controllers, making the codebase more maintainable. On the frontend, I implemented reusable UI components, which reduced redundancy and improved consistency across different pages of the application.

Testing

• Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
In a full-stack application, API testing is crucial for ensuring proper request and retrieval of data. I used Postman to test various API endpoints, including GET, POST, and PUT requests. Each endpoint required proper validation and error handling to ensure data integrity. Security layers, such as authentication and authorization, added complexity to testing, requiring strategies like token-based authentication (JWT) to secure API access.

Reflection

• How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
This course has been incrfedibly insightful in helping me progress toward my professional goals as a software engineer. I have developed skills in full-stack development, including frontend frameworks, backend API design, and database management. Additionally, working with authentication and security has enhanced my understanding of best practices for securing applications. These experiences have strengthened my ability to build and deploy functional web applications, making me a more competitive candidate in the job market. With the completion of this course I am more aware of how websites and applications function and how they handle data/data storage.
